# Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to evaluate a set of machine learning models used to predict credit risk. Four of the models use resampling techniques - RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, and SMOTEENN - and the other two - BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier - are meant to improve the performance of individual weak learners by combining their learnings.
